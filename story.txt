On the sunday morning, Di got up early and was going to go to the supermarket. However, it snowed heavily and we watched film home instead. 
He decided to watch Die Hard because it's clearly one of the greatest Christmas movies ever. Polar Express is good too, but Di wanted the best. 
After the movie, Di decided to have dinner with his girlfriend. But most restaurants closed due to the weather so they had to stay at home.
