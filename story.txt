On the sunday morning, Di got up early and was going to go to the supermarket. However, it snowed heavily and we watched film home instead.Then, he forgot to do his homework last night. In a panic, he got up, but started getting dizzy since he moved to quick. He fell back on his couch and decided to stay there for a little longer and watch another movie. This resulted in Di flipping through Netflix for about 45 minutes before deciding what to watch. He was feeling a romantic comedy. Several hours passed, Di watched 3 movies in a row. It is already Monday morning but Di does not feel well because of the movie night so he decides to skip today's lecture.
